# **OpenInventory**: Location-based inventory management for small businesses and individuals

This is a list of many user stories that I would want to implement in **OpenInventory**. The project idea came from a somewhat similar app I say at my internship which was used to show where everyone's desks were. The issue I ended up having though is that there was no version of that app for items (I worked in Electrical Engineering so parts, power supplies, oscilloscopes, or soldering stations). That is what **OpenInventory** aims to do, but on a much wider spectrum, for everything from home to shop organization.

## Illustrated Features

1. As a user, I want to create custom wireframe maps of living or work spaces so that I can accurately place objects where they are relative to the real world.
2. As an inventory manager, I want to have syncing wireframe maps and item locations across different users, so that multiple people can access the same information.
3. As an inventory manager, I want to be able to integrate existing inventory management software (simple software like Excel to more industry examples such as monday.com), so that transferring data is seamless.

## Other Highlighted Features

1. As a user, I want to search for items by keyword and have the location appear, so that it is easy to find parts.
2. As an inventory manager, I want to assign roles to users so that users without proper authorization cannot access the location of items requiring more security.
3. As a developer, I want OpenInventory to be free of charge so that individuals users as well as small businesses can use its features without paying for enterprise software.

## Other Features

1. As a user, I want to create sub directories for smaller areas / storage cabinets so that items can be located easily.
2. As an inventory manager, I want to label areas so that searching for items is as simple as possible for workers.
3. As a system administrator, I want to ensure all wireframe maps and locations of items are secure so that no person information is released.
4. As a user, I want to check out items, so that items that are temporarily removed from inventory are not permanently deleted.
5. As an inventory manager, I want to track which users check out or remove items so that missing items can be accounted for.
6. As a user, I want to add notification for certain items, so that items can be replaced or updated based on the timing.
7. As a developer, I want to add integration support with other extensions or software so that OpenInventory can keep up with new advancements.
8. As an inventory manager, I want to track levels of items over time, so that I can ensure that demand is met during certain time windows.
9. As a user, I want to filter on the wireframe map view for different categories of items, whether personal or operational, so that relative organization can be seen.
